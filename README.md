This code focused on reading stock and bond data from CSV files, storing them in a PostgreSQL database, and performing basic calculations to determine earnings or losses.

On improvising the code, adding a new library, ‘plotly’, which replaced matplotlib library for creating interactive visualization. This provides more dynamic and user-friendly graphs that could be easily explored and understood.

Additionally, the integration of the matplotlib.finance API provided an opportunity to examine price movements more closely, adding another layer of analysis to the existing dataset. By combining this with the plotly graphs, the code now offers a comprehensive view of both portfolio value over time and the detailed price of specific stocks.

Another enhancement is adding Tkinter to create a basic graphical user interface (GUI). This allows users to select input data files through a simple file dialog.

Additionally, the use of the Yahoo Finance API added real-time data retrieval capabilities, enabling the script to fetch the latest stock prices dynamically. By integrating this API, the script now offers more accurate and relevant data.

Pandas library is used for calculating moving averages. This new feature allows users to observe long-term trends in stock prices, providing a deeper understanding of market behavior over time. The moving averages are saved to a CSV file

To find out correlation between each stocks Seaborn library is used to creating a correlation heatmap between different stocks. This visualization helps users understand the relationships between various stocks

The integration of new libraries, real-time data retrieval, and advanced visualizations has significantly improved its functionality, making it a valuable asset for investors seeking to manage their portfolios effectively
